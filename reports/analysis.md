Analysis â€“ Visionary Architects Platform

The analysis phase of the e-Project identified several key requirements and constraints for creating a digital platform for an architecture firm.

### Stakeholder Requirements
- Showcase past and current architectural projects in a clean, modern layout
- Provide easy access to contact information and projects
- Allow scalability for future integration of client login and project tracking

### Functional Requirements
- Home, About, Projects, and Contact pages
- Ability to filter or sort projects by category, location, or style
- Mobile responsiveness for a smooth experience across devices

### Non-functional Requirements
- Intuitive navigation and clean visual hierarchy
- SEO-friendly codebase and accessible content structure

### Constraints and Considerations
- Design must reflect architectural precision and elegance
- Platform must be easy to update as new projects are completed
- Use of modern web technologies (React, CSS)

This analysis formed the basis for the design and development phases, aligning user needs with technical capabilities.
